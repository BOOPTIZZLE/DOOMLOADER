# Placeholder IR files for testing

These are placeholder files for testing DOOMLOADER's IR loading functionality.

To use real impulse responses:
1. Replace these files with actual .wav IR files
2. Or add your own IR files to this directory
3. Ensure they are 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate
4. Keep them under 2 seconds in length for best performance

Example IR files would be named:
- example-4x12.wav (4x12 cabinet simulation)
- example-2x12.wav (2x12 cabinet simulation)  
- example-1x12.wav (1x12 cabinet simulation)

For testing purposes, DOOMLOADER will handle missing IR files gracefully.
