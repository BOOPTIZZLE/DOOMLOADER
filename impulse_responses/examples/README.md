# DOOMLOADER Sample Impulse Responses

This directory contains example impulse response files for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Files

- `example-4x12.wav` - Simulated 4x12 cabinet response (placeholder)
- `example-2x12.wav` - Simulated 2x12 cabinet response (placeholder)  
- `example-1x12.wav` - Simulated 1x12 cabinet response (placeholder)

## Usage

These are minimal placeholder files for testing IR loading functionality. For production use, you should:

1. Use high-quality commercial or free IR libraries
2. Record your own IRs from actual cabinets
3. Match sample rates to your project (44.1kHz or 48kHz recommended)

## Sources for Quality IRs

### Free
- God's Cab - High-quality free impulse responses
- Lancaster Audio - Free starter packs
- Seacow Cabs - Vintage cabinet simulations

### Commercial
